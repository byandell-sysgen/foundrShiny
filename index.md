# foundrShiny

Shiny app tools companion package for
[foundr](https://github.com/byandell/foundr) package. To install:

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("byandell/foundr", ref = "foundrBase")
    devtools::install_github("byandell/foundrShiny")

This package can be used to build shiny apps for analysis and
visualization of founder data. It is part of a (planned) collection of
packages. See [Foundr App Developer
Guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/171HEopFlSTtf_AbrA28YIAJxJHvkzihB4_lcV6Ct-eI)
for an overview of package(s) use and components.

- [foundr](https://github.com/byandell/foundr): data analysis and
  visualization
  - See [foundrBase tree of
    foundr](https://github.com/byandell/foundr/tree/foundrBase) for the
    revised `foundr` package (in testing phase).
- [foundrShiny](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny): interactive
  shiny app
- [foundrHarmony](https://github.com/byandell/foundrHarmony): harmonize
  data from multiple sources (being written)
- [modulr](https://github.com/byandell/modulr): harmonize WGCNA module
  objects

## Improvements Planned

- order module list on contrast by p-values
- SD and logp calc and guideline defaults
- add pct eigenvalue from module
- larger points on several plots
- need to rethink foundr::ggplot_conditionContrasts, which is now
  bloated
- added
  [`panelApp()`](https://byandell-sysgen.github.io/foundrShiny/reference/panelApp.md)
  as a diagnostic tool to investigate tabs and panels

## foundrShiny Modular Organization

The foundrShiny package is completely organized using [Shiny
modules](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html). All files in
the `R` function directory have built-in apps following [shiny module
naming
conventions](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html#naming-conventions).
A useful guide is [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/).

The app has a primary module `foundr` with secondary modules for the tab
panels `trait`, `contrast`, `stats`, `time` and `about`.

- [foundr.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/foundr.R):
  main app; see also
  [app.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/inst/shinyApp/app.R):
  for deployment example.
- [trait.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/trait.R):
  trait visualization
- [contrast.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/contrast.R):
  contrasts of conditions across strains by sex
- [stats.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/stats.R):
  stats on design effects
- [time.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/time.R):
  traits over time
- [about.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/about.R):
  about this app

Specialized modules are called from these modules. Two additional files
that are not modules are the following:

- foundr_helpers.R: helper functions
- foundrSetup.R: setup data for all apps (requires data access)

## foundrShiny Parameters

Parameters are organized into sets

- `main_par` global parameters
- `panel_par` panel-specific parameters
- `plot_par` plot-specific parameters

These sets of parameters are
[reactiveValues](https://mastering-shiny.org/reactivity-objects.html)
placed in Shiny modules to simplify code readability through reuse.

The parameter sets are served up via servers, which depend on some data
object,

    main_par <- mainParServer("main_par", traitSignal)
    panel_par <- panelParServer("panel_par", main_par, traitSignal)
    plot_par <- plotParServer("plot_par", contrast_table)

and deployed via three UIs, which input parameter values. Each set is
organized in its own shiny module, complete with app.

- [mainPar.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/mainPar.R)
- [panelPar.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/panelPar.R)
- [plotPar.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/plotPar.R)

### Global Parameters (`main_par`)

The main parameters `main_par` are set in the main app in
[foundr.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/foundr.R)
and flow through to the panels

    mainParInput("main_par"), # dataset
    mainParUI("main_par"), # order
    mainParOutput("main_par"), # plot_table, height

### Plot-specific Parameters (`plot_par`)

This set is used in the
[contrastPlot.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/contrastPlot.R)
module, which is reused to develop contrast plots across traits.

    plotParInput("plot_par") # ordername, interact
    plotParUI("plot_par"), # volsd, volvert (sliders)
    plotParOutput("plot_par"), # rownames (strains/terms)

These parameters are used in the three types of plots called via
`contrastPlot`

- [volcano.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/volcano.R)
- [biplot.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/biplot.R)
- [dotplot.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/dotplot.R)

which are deployed in the `contrast` and `stats` panels via the
following modules

- [contrastSex.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/contrastSex.R):
  contrasts of conditions across strains by sex
- [contrastGroup.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/contrastGroup.R):
  contrasts for groups of traits (such as WGCNA modules)
- [stats.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny/blob/main/R/stats.R):
  stats on design effects

### Panel-specific Parameters (`panel_par`)

Panel parameters are reused in different panels in slightly different
ways. It made sense to allow these to let the user set these separately
within each panel. **This is in development and not yet implemented.**
Note that some modules have `input$trait` or `input$traits`. I have
begun migrating to panelPar in `traitTable`.

      panelParInput("panel_par"), # Strains, Facet
      panelParUI("panel_par"), # Traits
      panelParOutput("panel_par") # Sexes (B/F/M/C)

Some parameters are passed as lists from one module to another. For
instance, the `traitTable` module returns a - trait + traitTable:
strains + traitSolos: facet + traitPairs: facet - stats + contrastPlot:
sex - time + timePlot: strains, facet + timeTable: strains + timeTraits:
contrast (traits) - contrast + contrastSex: sex + contrastTime:
contrast, strains + timePlot: strains, facet + contrastGroup: sex,
group + contrastPlot: sex, strain (via volcano?)

Careful that contrastPlot and its sub-modules (volcano,biplot,dotplot)
us rownames from plotPar, which is substitute for strain. Volcano may
have wrong call for strain.

## Panel sub-modules

Panels deploy sub-modules, which in turn might deploy other sub-modules.
By convention, each module has a Server and one or more of Input, UI,
Output. Several sub-modules return reactive objects, which might be used
by other sub-modules.

### Trait module

- traitOrder
- traitNames (used twice)
- corTable
- corPlot
- traitTable
- traitSolos

### Stats module

  - traitOrder (reused from trait module)
- contrastSex
  - contrastPlot
